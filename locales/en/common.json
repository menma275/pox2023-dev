    "Concept" : "Proof of X is an art exhibition that focuses on NFT and blockchain technology.This exhibition, which is scheduled for April 2022, is a sequel to the \"Proof of X - NFT as New Media Art\" exhibition, which aimed to capture NFT as a unique technology and medium. It showcases the works of domestic and international artists who focus on blockchain and smart contracts, which are the \"core\" of NFT. It has been a year since the last \"Proof of X\" exhibition, and the situation surrounding NFT art has changed significantly. After experiencing the so-called \"crypto winter\" crash, the speculative fever for NFT art has gradually cooled down, and the question of what NFT art is and what it can do is being reconsidered. This means that we need to re-examine the potential for blockchain, which has demonstrated that technology can be a manifestation of ideology, and the power (or precariousness) of \"code execution\" through smart contracts that are deployed there.There are works known as \"Dynamic NFT\" or \"Programmable NFT\" that can change the image and attributes of a work in response to external data or user actions by utilizing smart contracts. These works, which are created by artists, allow art to establish a variety of relationships starting from the blockchain. The potential of smart contracts, which are executed with transparency, is vast, and they have the potential to change the relationship between artists and audiences, collectors, and curators, which have been distinguished thus far, and eventually expand the field of art itself, and transform the creative activities that human beings have been engaged in. NFT has the potential to form a new social image beyond the field of art by being incorporated into a more complex digital ecosystem, rather than a simple digital asset.We hope that this exhibition will present various aspects of evolving digital culture and foster better discussions.",

    "1stExhibit" : "The first edition of \"Proof of X\" was held at 3331 Arts Chiyoda in Tokyo from April 22 to May 1, 2022. Under the title \"Proof of X NFT as New Media Art,\" the exhibition introduced works created in the course of gaining insight into NFT as a unique technology and medium, rather than using it as a mechanism for selling image data (for speculative purposes). Without taking a one-size-fits-all viewpoint (and sometimes taking a critical look at it), the artists looked at what NFT is and the characteristics that lie behind its surface, and presented works that incorporated various ideas.",
